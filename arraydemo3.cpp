// we will start searching from leftmost element or first element and if  element we are searching ==element to be searched (key) then we will terminate the loop and end otherwise if it is not found out we will move to next element
//A simple approach is to do a linear search, i.e

// Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
// If x matches with an element, return the index.
// If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.
//linear search (Searching algorithm) which is used to find whether a given number 
//is present in an array and if it is present then at what location it occurs.
// It is also known as sequential search. It is straightforward and works as follows: We keep on comparing each element with the element to search until it is found or the list ends.
